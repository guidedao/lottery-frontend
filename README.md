## Internationalization

This project uses [next-globe-gen](https://github.com/next-globe-gen/next-globe-gen) for internationalization (i18n). This TypeScript package makes it easy to add multi-language support to Next.js apps with automatic language routes, locale detection, and smart translations.

For a comprehensive guide on implementing Next.js localization with next-globe-gen, check out the [Lokalise tutorial](https://lokalise.com/blog/nextjs-localization/).

## Web3 Libraries

This project uses the following libraries for Web3 integration:

- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/why) – A collection of React Hooks for Ethereum, designed for ease of use and flexibility.
- [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com/docs/) – A React library for connecting Ethereum wallets with a beautiful, customizable UI.
